## Description 📌

Zapplicant is a web application designed for hiring managers and HR professionals with the aim of managing job applicants in a visually intuitive manner.

It allows the user to enter, modify, filter and rate potential employees based on the results of their interviews.

### Overview 🤞

        Welcome to your third and final group project!

        This project serves as your best opportunity to showcase all the skills you’ve learned throughout this course and collaborate with the community of developers you’ve cultivated over the past six months.

        You’ll work with your group to build a performant and scalable MERN stack single-page application that fulfills a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand.

## Installation 🛠

```
npm install
```

This should run the install scripts in all directories (server, client, and root). Once the installation completes, to run locally, run

```
npm run develop
```

This should start the react front end as proxy as well as the graphql and backend server

```
npm run seed
```

```
npm i
npm start
```

http://localhost:5000/graphql
```

Clicking the link will open the GraphQL web page where you can view the schema and run desired queries.
