## Description 📌

//

### Overview 🤞

        Welcome to your third and final group project!

        This project serves as your best opportunity to showcase all the skills you’ve learned throughout this course and collaborate with the community of developers you’ve cultivated over the past six months.

        You’ll work with your group to build a performant and scalable MERN stack single-page application that fulfills a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand.

## Installation 🛠

From the root directory, run

```
npm install
```

This should run the install scripts in all directories (server, client, and root). Once the installation completes, to run locally, run

```
npm run develop
```

This should start the react front end as proxy as well as the graphql and backend server

## Seeding the Database

In order to have some data in the db you will need to run the follwoing command after installation. The command should be run from the root directory. It expects to have access to a local mongoose db.

```
npm run seed
```

## Usage 💻

### GraphQL

To use graphQL locally, run the start the server by running

```
npm i
npm start
```

The output should give you a link to the GraphQL Server. It will will look like

```
http://localhost:5000/graphql
```

Clicking the link, will open the GraphQL web page where you can view the schema and run desired queries.
It is recommended that you seed the DB before you execute this step.
